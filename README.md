# vanilla-js-router example

This is an example app for the vanilla-js-router library found [here](https://github.com/daleighan/vanilla-js-router).
To get started with it first, clone the repository. Then, run `npm install`.
Once dependencies are installed, you can either run `npm run dev` to build it and have it rebuild on save for development, or run `npm run build` to build it with optimizations for production. To start the express server, run `npm start` and then visit http://localhost:4200 to view it.
